A collection bootloaders for microcontrollers such as TinyBootloader. This collection contains tested ASM & HEX files for PIC and other microcontrollers.

If you are looking for a bootloder for your controller, you may find it within our SVN Repository:
http://code.google.com/p/microcontroller-bootloaders/source/browse/#svn/trunk

Please email a project owner if you wish to join & contribute. We would like to see your tested tiny bootloader files. If you do not wish to join, but would still like to add your bootloader files, please email them to us.

All files should named in a similar format and must be uploded in both ASM and HEX. For example:

tinybld18f452\_10mhz\_external\_115k.hex (18f452 at 10mhz external crystal, 115k serial transfer rate)

If this bootloader file uses PLL, Please add 40mhz\_pll to the filename:

tinybld18f452\_10mhz\_external\_40mhz\_pll\_115k.hex (10mhz external crystal running at pll frequency 40mhz)
